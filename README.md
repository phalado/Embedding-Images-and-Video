# Embedding Images and Video

Embedding Images and Video is the first project in the Microverse curriculum. It consists of a static Youtube-like page, where you can play a selected video.

## Link to assignment

The assignment can be found in the Odin Project's HTML and CSS course that can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/embedding-images-and-video).

## Technologies used

Basic HTML5 and CSS. Since it´s only a static page it was not necessary to use JavaScript or another language.
